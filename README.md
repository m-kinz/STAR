See accompanying paper and supplemental material:

Using this toolkit, topological metrics can be evaluated using principal component analysis and encompass the center of mass, volume, and size of the TVs together with their depth inside the body. Morphology of TVs can be quantified by histogram metrics using Hounsfield Units (HU) of planning CT. Dose distribution can be characterized by various conformity and homogeneity indexes.
